The Open Design Engine processes and renders designs and provides interface to query and manipulate their contents.

- [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)

## How to build

1. Make sure you have installed [CMake](https://cmake.org/), [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/en/getting-started.html), and a C++ compiler (e.g. Visual Studio, XCode, or g++).
2. Linux & Mac only: Using APT or Homebrew, install `automake autoconf autoconf-archive`
3. (Optional) I would recommend setting your vcpkg directory as persistent system variable `VCPKG_ROOT`. If you do, you may omit the `-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` option in the following step.
4. Generate CMake build, e.g. `cmake -S . -B build/win64 -A x64 -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=C:/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake`
5. Build generated project, e.g. `cmake --build build/win64`

### MacOS build

1. Install xcode: `xcode-select --install`
2. Install deps from brew: `brew install autoconf automake autoconf-archive pkg-config cmake ninja`
3. Configure: `cmake --preset osx-dbg` or `cmake --preset osx-rel`
4. Build: `cmake --build --preset osx-dbg` or `cmake --build --preset osx-dbg`

## Maintainer guidelines

- The version of ODE is defined in [vcpkg.json](vcpkg.json) and automatically parsed from this file for other purposes.
- Some committed files are machine-generated. These are (should be) marked as such at the very beginning. Apart from submodules, currently all such files are generated by [generate-api-bindings.py](generate-api-bindings.py). Do not modify any generated files by hand and make sure they are up-to-date before committing by re-running the script. This is only needed when the `ODE_API` headers are changed. I am considering either having the script run automatically by CMake or having the CI check that the generated files are up-to-date in the future.
- All commit messages must be capitalized
