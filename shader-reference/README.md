# Shader reference directory

This directory is not a part of the solution but contains reference implementation for some of the shaders used in ODE.
The scripts, which are also used to test these shaders, can be run in Shadron, a proprietary software that can be acquired at [www.shadron.info](http://www.shadron.info).
